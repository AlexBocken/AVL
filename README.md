# AVL

This is a vocabulary list for Anki derived from the Advanced Vocabulary List (AVL). It includes no. 201 to no. 520.

This vocab list is for the purpose of stuyding these words for my course [Advanced English for academic purposes C1-C2](https://www.sprachenzentrum.uzh.ch/de/angebot/Kursdetail.html?sprachid=sprache:englisch&targetgpid=zielgruppe:studentETHZ&kursnr=217424a3-e447-4531-9d39-3b04ea63006e) at university.
A heavy focus is set on cognates and collocations for each word family, not just a definition for each word. For time management reasons, I've decided to just rip the information from ozdic.com.

There might be some manual modifications from time to time but my implementation of this port is rather ugly, making adjustments cumbersome.

I'm using Anki as my vocab program with the Addon [CrowdAnki](https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki) to export in a diff-friendly json-file. You can easily add it to yout Anki setup via the code given on [it's AnkiWeb page](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1788670778).
